It's just a prayer, and I'm aware it's fading, but oh
Where'd my love retreat? I stare out as the curtain
Tears on up high on the stage, so fare-thee-well
We'll leave our peace, and never meet up again

My tongue is tied, no thoughts on the mind
When every feeling fades out, nothing behind
And all the pressure, pushing's leavin' me tired and drained

I tie a muzzle tight to cover my heart
To keep the mind in check, my words under bars
But every corpse-likе sound is screaming to break from the chains

I hide my eyes from shame, I regret
As all my failures build up blinds in my head
'Cause now I'm in too deep, but down to the end I'll remain
A tired rasp stings straight down a throat I neglect
I try to find a glass, but everything's wrecked
Without a word, I stare, not knowing a thing I should say

Every feeling that I had inside has now all left me out to dry
Sorta the same now, sorta different, sorta sly
I don't know how far down I'll make it, or if I can see you out
What, oh, are you thinking as you're sinking in the darkness now?

If I never get to see you again
If I never come and find you, my friend
Then I'll tie you ever tightly here beside me, never slowing
If you find you have a chance here with me
If you never wanna get up and leave
Then don't give up on that feeling, the future's ours for reaching
Soon you'll see

Peaceful, happy days, for attrition's paid
In truth, it's all the same
The pain and pleasure both divvy the weight
Every sad regret, every panting breath
Let's run and break away, this hall's doomed anyway

I whisper in the wistful, warping setting sun
Always the same, it's always the same wish, everyone
I don't know how to start this journey, or if I've forgotten how
What, oh, am I thinking as I'm sinking in the darkness now?

If we're ever-growing sick of this bet
If there's ever nothing more to be said
Then I'll free you from the nightmare here beside me, never slowing
So we both can keep a cage on our hearts
So we stop from ever falling apart
Let's exchange those very pieces, I'll treasure all their heat
So let's start

La-ru-la-ri-da, la-ru-la-ri-da, la-ru-la-ri-da
La-ru-la-ri-da, la-ru-la-ri-da, la-ru-la-ri-da

Crying there with you
Laughing after you
Fighting there with you
Singing there with you
Dance a pas de deux
Chatting there with you

Whisper in the wistful, warping setting sun
Always the same, it's always the same, I can't go on
So that I never lose your breath upon my nape, I'll carry on
In the end, I wonder, just how long I'll have to keep these thoughts
Only us again, if

If I never get to see you again
If I never come and find you, my friend
Then I'll tie you ever tightly here beside me, never slowing
If you find you have a chance here with me
If you never wanna get up and leave
I'll make sure this precious feeling, the reason for my being is
Always, always, free and eternal like my never ending love
